# Disable chat signing for Paper servers

Tested on 1.20.4

I got a 7 day ban on a friends private server and thought it was pretty ridiculous hence this plugin. The server changes each chat message by appending a space to the end of the message. Since messages have to be cryptographically signed in order to be reportable, this changes the message so the cryptographic signature will no longer match the message
